## Introduction
In this project, I’ve created a mini-lab on Microsoft Azure, demonstrating the process of vulnerability scanning and management using OpenVAS. 

The setup includes a virtual network within my Azure subscription, hosting two virtual machines. One serves as a management server equipped with OpenVAS, while the other is intentionally configured with insecure software to simulate a vulnerable target. I conducted both uncredentialed and credentialed scans, providing a comprehensive view of the system’s vulnerabilities. After removing the insecure software, I ran another credentialed scan to observe the changes. This project offers valuable insights into the process of identifying, managing, and mitigating system vulnerabilities.

## Uncredentialed Scan Before Remediation

The uncredentialed scan conducted on the insecure Windows 10 VM revealed a series of vulnerabilities that provide a comprehensive understanding of the system’s security posture. T

Key findings include vulnerabilities related to DCE/RPC and MSRPC Services Enumeration Reporting, which could potentially allow unauthorized users to gather sensitive information about the system. Deprecated SSL/TLS protocols were also detected, indicating the use of outdated encryption methods that could be exploited. Additionally, potential information disclosure vulnerabilities were identified, suggesting the system could inadvertently reveal sensitive information.

## Credentialed Scan Before Remediation

With a credentialed scan, key vulnerabilities were found in widely used software applications such as Adobe Reader and Mozilla Firefox. These vulnerabilities ranged from multiple vulnerabilities in different versions of Adobe Reader to a Sandbox Bypass Vulnerability in Adobe Reader.

## Credentialed Scan After Remediation

Key findings include vulnerabilities related to Microsoft Defender Antimalware Platform and Windows IEExpress. These vulnerabilities, while still present, are significantly fewer in number compared to the pre-remediation scan. This reduction in vulnerabilities underscores the importance of regular system updates and the removal of unnecessary or insecure software.

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini-lab was established in Microsoft Azure to demonstrate the process of vulnerability scanning and management using OpenVAS. The lab consisted of two virtual machines, one serving as a management server and the other simulating a vulnerable target with insecure software. Both uncredentialed and credentialed scans were conducted, providing a comprehensive view of the system’s vulnerabilities.

Following the initial scans, remediation measures were implemented, which involved the removal of the insecure software. A subsequent credentialed scan was performed, revealing a significant reduction in the number of vulnerabilities. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation measures in enhancing the system’s security posture.

It’s important to note that if the system was under heavy usage or if it contained more complex applications, it’s likely that a larger number of vulnerabilities might have been identified. This underscores the importance of regular and thorough vulnerability scanning, especially in environments with high levels of activity or complexity. This project serves as a testament to the critical role of proactive vulnerability management in maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses.
